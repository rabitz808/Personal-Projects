# Poke API

This is a personal project to create a custom Pokemon API with data from the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald games.

## Features

This API provides data on 202 unique Pokemon from the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald games, including their name, picture, Pokedex number, types, weakness, species, and evolutions with the level they evolve.

## Usage

To use the API, simply clone the repository and import the `pokemonData` object from the `data.js` file. You can then access the data for any Pokemon by referencing its name as a property of the object.

```javascript
const pokemonData = require('./data.js');

const bulbasaurData = pokemonData['bulbasaur'];
console.log(bulbasaurData);
```

This will log the following object to the console:

```javascript
{
  picture: 'https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/bulbasaur.jpg',
  pokedexNo: 1,
  types: [ 'Grass', 'Poison' ],
  weakness: [ 'Fire', 'Psychic', 'Flying', 'Ice' ],
  species: 'Seed Pok√©mon',
  evolutions: [
    { name: 'Bulbasaur', level: 1 },
    { name: 'Ivysaur', level: 16 },
    { name: 'Venusaur', level: 32 }
  ]
}
```

## Known Limitations

Please note that this API is currently a work in progress, and while efforts have been made to ensure that all information is accurate and up-to-date, some discrepancies may still exist. It is also important to note that the 'evolutions' property may appear as 'null' for Pokemon that evolve using specific methods, such as evolution stones, rather than reaching a specified level.

## Feedback and Contributions

If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions for this API, please feel free to create an issue or reach out to me on GitHub. Contributions are also welcome and appreciated.
