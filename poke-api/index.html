    <h1>Using the Pokemon API</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to my simple Pokemon API! This API provides information on all 202
      unique Pokemon from the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald games. Below is an
      example of how to access the data for a specific Pokemon:
    </p>

    <pre><code>const pokemon = pokemonData["pikachu"];
console.log(pokemon);</code></pre>

    <p>
      You may also access the data using /api/pokemon-name. Below is an example
      of how to access the data for a specific Pokemon:
    </p>

    <pre><code>localhost:8000/api/pikachu</code></pre>

    <p>
      This will return an object containing all the data for Pikachu, including
      its picture, pokedex number, types, weakness, species, and evolutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use this API in your own projects, simply copy and paste the JavaScript
      object containing the Pokemon data into your code, or reference it from a
      separate .js file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please be advised that this API is currently a work in progress, and while
      efforts have been made to ensure that all information is accurate and
      up-to-date, some discrepancies may still exist. If you have any questions
      or feedback regarding this API, please feel free to reach out to me on
      GitHub. It is important to note that one of the limitations of this API is
      the 'evolutions' property. If a Pokemon evolves using a specific method
      such as an evolution stone, rather than reaching a specified level, this
      property will appear as 'null'.
